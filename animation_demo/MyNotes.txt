(1) For generate pdf we need to jspdf pakage (npm i jspdf)

(2) Arguments of jsPDF
Orientation: ‘p’ for portrait or ‘l’ for landscape
Unit: ‘p’ (points), ‘mm’, ‘cm’, ‘m’, ‘in’, or ‘px’. We will be positioning elements in the PDF using these units. I suggest using ‘px’ since that’s our common CSS unit of measurement.
Format: ‘letter’, ‘legal’, ‘ledger’, etc. You can also use the alphanumeric international paper size chart that ranges from ‘a0’ to ‘c10’. ‘a4’ translates to letter-sized paper.
